phase 3

Designed and implementd gtk interface according to specification.

FUNCTIONALITY:

directory back up works but does not ask user before overwriting the folder
eg: when the directory already exists, you will be asked for comfirmation in the terminal. until you enter Y/N the 
program wont start the backup process.

program uses global variables to store the source and destination path.

The progress bar starts after backing up is done.
